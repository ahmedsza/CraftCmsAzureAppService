This is sample script for deploying the craft CMS Spoke and Chain solution using containers with Azure App Service

This uses azure cli and powershell

it is recommended to run this in steps. i,e it is not fully automated. a portion where the sql is imported should pref be done in the cloud shell

The ssl connection to mysql still need to be resolved. for now ssl is disabled.
